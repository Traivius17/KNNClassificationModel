# KNNClassificationModel 

KNN Classification Model that uses NumPy framework and Pandas library with a emphasis of utilization on dictionary comprehension and enumerate.

Demonstrating skills in manually creating dictionaries to be used to replace categorial data with discrete values in a step by step manner.

Also used an automated method using enumerate in order to create dictionaries to replace categorial data with discrete values.

The data of the CSV consisted of features of vehicles of the following:
            make, model, year, color, curr_mileage, purchase_price, curr_value and stolen
            
The target data of the model was determine what values of feature elements would determine the likelihood of a vehicle being stolen.
